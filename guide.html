                    <h2>What is a Heat Pump?</h2>
                    <p>A heat pump is a device that efficiently transfers heat between the indoors and outdoors to provide both heating and cooling, depending on the season. In a ductwork-based home, the heat pump usually replaces the air conditioner. Moving heat from one spot to another takes far less energy than creating heat from burning a fossil fuel or heating up an electrical element.<br><br>Most homeowners don’t realize that they already own several heat pumps. Their fridge, freezer, home’s air conditioner and car’s air conditioner are all heat pumps. They all move the unwanted heat from inside to outside thereby reducing the resulting temperature (i.e. cool is the absence of heat). The only problem with a traditional home air conditioner, however, is that it is only capable of moving the heat from inside the home to outside (i.e. cooling season), but not taking heat from outside and moving it to inside.<br><br>Heat pumps are usually capable of heating down to outside temperatures just under freezing such as >-5C. A subset of heat pumps, referred to as cold climate heat pumps, is designed to operate efficiently in lower temperatures, often well below freezing.</p>

                    <h2>What is a Furnace?</h2>
                    <p>A home’s furnace is a heating system that uses natural gas, propane or fuel oil to generate heat. It works by igniting the fuel in a burner, which produces heat in the form of hot air. This hot air is then distributed throughout the home via a blower and a network of ducts.</p>

                <h2>How to Identify the Amperage Rating of Your Home's Electrical Panel</h2>
                <p>To identify the amperage of your electrical panel, look for the largest breaker switch inside the panel, usually located at the top or bottom and separate from the rows of smaller breakers. This main breaker controls the power to the entire panel. The amperage rating, commonly 100, 150, or 200 amps, is typically printed on end of the handle(s) of the main breaker. If the rating isn’t visible on the breaker, check for a label inside the panel door or on the side of the panel. It is often possible to identify the panel’s rating visually without having to touch any surface. Having a flashlight handy will be helpful if the area where it’s located is not well lit. If you are unsure or don’t feel safe, however, leave it and arrange for a certified electrician to obtain the rating for you.</p>

                    <h2>What is a Ducted Heat Pump?</h2>
                    <p>A heat pump that distributes its heat and cool through the home's ductwork system is referred to as a ducted heat pump. It contrasts a ‘ductless heat pump’ which a heat pump which distributes its heat and cool using an independent and stand-alone fan unit. These devices are often found in homes that do not have ductwork. They may instead have radiators or in-floor heating.</p>

                    <h2>What is a Ductless Heat Pump?</h2>
                    <p>For homes that do not have ductwork (e.g. they would instead have radiators, in-floor heating, wood stove or electric baseboards), homeowners installing heat pumps for supplementary heating and cooling would need to consider ductless units which are also known as ‘mini-splits’. The heat pump mechanism would sit outside of the home (either mounted on the side of the home or on a purpose-built stand on the ground) and be connected to one or more discrete wall-mounted fan units inside the home which distribute the warm and cool air. On most modern models, the inside fan units can be individually controlled for different temperatures and fan speeds. This is a helpful feature allowing a homeowner to more precisely concentrate the amount of heating and cooling in certain areas. For some homes whose existing ductwork struggles to send sufficient amounts of warm and cool air in extremities of the building (e.g. most often in bedrooms on top floors), however, a ductless heat pump can nicely complement the central heating and cooling system. Rather than the homeowner having to over cool or heat most of the home just to enable some of the conditioned air to reach these problems areas, an independent ductless heat pump will easily shore up the deficiency.</p>

                    <h2>What is an Electric Furnace?</h2>
                    <p>An electric furnace for a home is a heating system that uses electric resistance coils to generate heat. The coils are located inside an air-handler that’s connected to the home’s ductwork, just like a traditional gas furnace; the two side-by-side would look very similar. When electricity passes through these coils, they heat up and warm the air. This heated air is then circulated throughout the home using the air-handler’s blower and the home’s ductwork.  A heat pump is often integrated into the electric furnace allowing the home to be heated by the pump for the majority of the winter. The electric coils will come on whenever the outside temperature becomes too cold for the heat pump to manage to meet the homeowner’s heating needs on its own. While electric furnaces are known for their simplicity, quiet operation, and ease of installation, they can be expensive to operate, especially during times of peak electricity rates. Homeowners will need to have a licensed electrician to determine if the home’s electrical service has sufficient capacity to handle the high electrical demand of an electric furnace.</p>
