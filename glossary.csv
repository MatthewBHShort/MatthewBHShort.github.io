Air Handler,An air handler (a.k.a. forced-air)  is a central component of a home's HVAC system that circulates and conditions air through the home’s ductwork to ensure consistent heating and cooling throughout the space.The unit is traditionally a fairly large sheet metal constructed box that sits on the basement floor and reaches up to the ceiling in the basement.,AirHandler.jpg
R-Value,"The R-value is a measure of an insulation material's resistance to allowing heat to flow or escape. Therefore, it’s best to have insulation with as high an R-value as possible (e.g. R-60 for attics and R-25 for walls)",R-Value.jpg
Energy Audit,"A home energy audit is an assessment that evaluates the energy efficiency performance of a house. A certified auditor will take approximately 60 - 90 mins to inspect the home’s insulation, heating and cooling equipment, windows and doors and walls, and then run a blower test or use infrared cameras to identify areas where energy is being lost. The results are summarized in a succinct report along with recommendations on the various measures the homeowner could implement to improve the level of efficiency. Expect to pay up to $500 for the audit and report or up to $800 for a pre and post pair of implemented energy measure audits and report with the latter often being a prerequisite for receiving grants. Regardless of whether a grant is being pursued or not, homeowners who are serious about improving the performance of their home are strongly encouraged to have a energy audit done. It is an excellent tool to help provide homeowners a compass on where and how to focus their time and money.",EnergyAudit.jpg
Electrical Panel,"An electrical panel (a.k.a. a breaker panel) is a component that houses circuit breakers and distributes electricity throughout the home, ensuring safe power distribution. 

How to identify the amperage-rating of your home’s electrical panel: To identify the amperage of your electrical panel, look for the largest breaker switch inside the panel, usually located at the top or bottom and separate from the rows of smaller breakers. This main breaker controls the power to the entire panel. The amperage rating, commonly 100, 150, or 200 amps, is typically printed on end of the handle(s) of the main breaker. If the rating isn’t visible on the breaker, check for a label inside the panel door or on the side of the panel. It is often possible to identify the panel’s rating visually without having to touch any surface. Having a flashlight handy will be helpful if the area where it’s located is not well lit. If you are unsure or don’t feel safe, however, leave it and arrange for a certified electrician to obtain the rating for you.",ElectricalPanel.jpg
Smart Thermostat,A device that automatically controls the temperature in the home. It is typically connected to the internet via the home’s WiFi enabling it to be controlled by a smartphone or computer. Most smart thermostats can control multiple heating devices which is the basis of a hybrid heating system involving a heat pump and furnace system. It is also capable of having the homeowner program different temperature settings for different times to accommodate varying temperature preference settings (e.g. cooler temperatures for sleepiing) as well as adjusting the temperature according to as on-peak and off-peak electricity pricing.,SmartThermostat.jpg
Hybrid Heating,"Hybrid heating systems combine a heat pump with furnace (gas, propane, oil) to optimize energy efficiency and comfort in the home based on current weather conditions.",HybridHeating.jpg
Vapour Barrier,"A vapor barrier is a material installed in a home's construction to prevent moisture from passing through walls, floors, and ceilings, thereby reducing the risk of mold and structural damage. The barrier can take the form of plastic sheets and sealable foam. It is one of the most important components in the home.",VapourBarrier.jpg
Induction Stove,An induction stove uses electromagnetic fields to directly heat pots and pans rather than either an electric element or natural gas flame. Induction offers more precise temperature control and faster cooking compared to traditional gas or electric stoves. This appliance will also not heat up the kitchen anywhere near as much as traditional gas and electric stoves.,InductionStove.jpg
Furnace,"A home’s furnace is a heating system that uses natural gas, propane or fuel oil to generate heat. It works by igniting the fuel in a burner, which produces heat in the form of hot air. This hot air is then distributed throughout the home via a blower and a network of ducts.",Furnace.jpg
Boiler,"A home boiler is a heating system (a.k.a. Hydronic heating) that uses water to provide warmth through radiators or underfloor heating rather than blowing air through a ductwork system. The boiler typically combusts fossil fuel such as natural gas, propane or oil. Unlike a ductwork based system, a hydronic system is not used for cooling thereby requiring a separate system altogether to cool the premise.",Boiler.jpg
Heat Pump,"A heat pump is a device that efficiently transfers heat between the indoors and outdoors to provide both heating and cooling, depending on the season. In a ductwork-based home, the heat pump usually replaces the air conditioner. Moving heat from one spot to another takes far less energy than creating heat from burning a fossil fuel or heating up an electrical element. 

Most homeowners don’t realize that they already own several heat pumps. Their fridge, freezer, home’s air conditioner and car’s air conditioner are all heat pumps. They all move the unwanted heat from inside to outside thereby reducing the resulting temperature (i.e. cool is the absence of heat). The only problem with a traditional home air conditioner, however, is that it is only capable of moving the heat from inside the home to outside (i.e. cooling season), but not taking heat from outside and moving it to inside.

Heat pumps are usually capable of heating down to outside temperatures just under freezing such as >-5C. A subset of heat pumps, referred to as cold climate heat pumps, is designed to operate efficiently in lower temperatures, often well below freezing.",HeatPump.jpg
Electric Baseboard Heaters,"Electric baseboard heaters are heating units installed along the baseboards of walls. They operate by using electrical resistance to generate heat, similarly to a toaster. The heat produced is then radiated into the room. Each unit usually has its own thermostat, allowing for individual room temperature control. Electric baseboard heaters are easy and inexpensive to install  making them useful for supplemental heating and/or in homes without ductwork. They do use a lot of energy so homeowners need to watch their utility bills with this type of heating.",ElectricBaseboardHeaters.jpg
Electric Furnace,A home’s electric furnace is a ductwork-based heating system that converts electrical energy into heat to warm the indoor air. It consists of electric heating elements inside an air handler that’s connected to the home’s ductwork. A blower fan circulates air over these heating elements and distributes the warmed air through ductwork to heat the various rooms of the house. Cold climate heat pumps are often connected to the electric furnace’s air handler so this more efficient technology can provide most of the home’s heating needs as well as all of its cooling needs.,ElectricFurnace.jpg
Ductless Heat Pump,"A ductless heat pump (a.k.a. a mini-split system) provides efficient heating and cooling directly to individual rooms or zones without the need for ductwork which is characteristic of older homes that may be heated with radiators or electric baseboard heaters. Often one heat pump can supply more than one interior fan unit. The interior fan units can be individually controlled as well making heat or cool zoning in a home much easier. Some homeowners will often install a ductless unit on a top floor to supplement the home’s main ductwork-based system which itself may struggle to properly heat and cool this extreme area of the home. 

As in the case of heat pumps operating within a ductwork-based home, ductless heat pumps typically continue working down to temperatures just under freezing such as >-5C. Cold climate ductless heat pumps are also available that can operate down to much lower temperatures, however.",DuctlessHeatPump.jpg
Heat Pump Clothes Dryer,A heat pump clothes dryer uses a heat pump to recycle and reuse air to dry clothes more efficiently and with lower energy consumption compared to traditional electric and gas-fired dryers. Heat pump dryers do not need venting to the outside of the home which reduces the load on the home’s heating and cooling system since the HVAC does not have to make up for the volume of air that would otherwise have been exhausted.,HeatPumpClothesDryer.jpg
LED Lighting,"Light-emitting diode lights are energy-efficient lighting sources that produce bright illumination with minimal heat output and lower energy consumption. Since LED’s don’t generate as much heat, they can last up to 50 times longer than incandescent lights which is both a savings and huge convenience.",LEDLighting.jpg
EV Charger,"A home EV charger is a device permanently installed in a residence that allows for the efficient charging of electric vehicles directly from the home's electrical system. The unit must be installed by a licensed electrician as it involves a dedicated circuit at 240V that’s typically rated for 15A at a minimum up to a maximum of 60A. The industry term for this charger-type is ‘Level-2’ which contrasts a Level-1 charger that is not permanently connected to a dedicated electric circuit, but rather can just be plugged into a regular wall socket. Electricians are typically not required to be involved with Level-1 chargers.",EVCharger.jpg
Tankless Water Heater,"A tankless water heater (a.k.a. on-demand water heater) heats water on demand without storing it in a tank, providing continuous hot water while saving energy and space. The energy type most commonly used is natural gas or propane. Occasionally they can be electrical tankless water heaters.",TanklessWaterHeater.jpg
Soffit,"A soffit is the underside of a building's overhanging eaves, providing ventilation to the attic and protecting the roof's structure from weather damage. Its function to provide unimpeded ventilation to the home’s attic is critically important to the home performing optimally.",Soffit.jpg
HVAC,"Acronym for heating, ventillation, and air conditioning system in the home.",HVAC.jpg
Building Envelope,"The physical barrier between the interior and exterior of the building (walls, roof, and foundation). A well-designed envelope will minimize the amount of energy loss.",BuildingEnvelope.jpg
Ductwork,"It is a system of conduits, usually located inside walls and attics and under floors, that distribute warm and cold air from the home's furnace and air conditioner throughout the home.",Ductwork.jpg
Solar Water Heater,"This is a device involving solar collectors, usually mounted on a roof, that uses sunlight to heat water in a storage tank for domestic use in a home. Normally the solar system is installed to operate just ahead of a conventional water heater to preheat the temperature of the water being fed into the latter thereby reducing the amount of energy (e.g. electricity, natural gas, oil) to heat water the homeowner will need to purchase.",SolarWaterHeater.jpg
Refrigerant,"A refrigerant is a special type of fluid used in cooling systems, like air conditioners, heat pumps, refrigerators and freezers, to absorb and release heat. It helps keep things cold by circulating through the system, taking heat from inside (like in your fridge or home in the summer) and releasing it outside. This process is what cools the air or keeps food fresh.",Refrigerant.jpg
Plate Solar Water Heater,"A plate-based solar hot water heater is a system that uses flat, sun-exposed panels (often called solar collectors) to absorb sunlight and convert it into heat. This heat is then transferred to water that flows through tubes attached to the plates. The heated water is stored in a tank for use in the home, providing an eco-friendly and energy-efficient way to generate hot water using the sun's energy.",PlateSolarWaterHeater.jpg
Evacuated Solar Water Heater,"An evacuated tube solar hot water heater is a system that uses sunlight to heat water for household use. It consists of multiple glass tubes, each containing a vacuum to reduce heat loss. Inside each tube, a metal absorber collects solar energy and transfers the heat to the water or a heat transfer fluid. The heated water is then stored in a tank for use in showers, sinks, and other hot water needs. This system is efficient even in colder climates, as the vacuum insulation helps retain heat.",EvacuatedSolarWaterHeater.jpg
ROI,Return on investment. It is a measure of how profitable an investment is.,ROI.jpg
Solar Array,A solar array is a group of interconnected solar panels that work together to generate electricity from sunlight.,SolarArray.jpg
Solar Panel,"A solar panel is an individual unit that converts sunlight into electricity. In turn, a collection of multiple solar panels connected and working together becomes a solar array.",SolarPanel.jpg
